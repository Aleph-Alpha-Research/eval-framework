### Issue Pick-Up
1. Pick issues in the order: **Urgent → Important → Open**. Always aim to clear the Urgent board first.
2. Soft rule: you may pick fun issues, even if not urgent, to keep things engaging.
3. **Assign Yourself**: Make sure you assign yourself to the issue.
4. **Move Issue Across Boards**:
   - `In Progress` → when actively working
   - `In Review` → if there’s a related PR being reviewed
   - `Done` → when issue is resolved
